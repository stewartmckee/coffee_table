h2. Intro 
  
  CoffeeTable was born out of a frustration with the standard caching methods around.  Maintaining the cache keys constantly was a headache and 'bet its a caching issue' was a phrase uttered way too much.  CoffeeTable maintains a list of its keys in a known format and when expiry is required for an object it knows which ones to expire
